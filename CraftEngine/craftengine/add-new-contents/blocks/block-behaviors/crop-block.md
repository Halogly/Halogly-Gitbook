[ðŸŒ½ Crop Block](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/blocks/block-behaviors/crop-block) is a type of block that grows over time. When receiving random ticks, it has a chance to advance to the next growth stage. However, if the plant lacks sufficient light, it will either stop growing or drop as an item.

You **must** configure the `age` property for this block, as it determines its stages. If you are unsure how to set up properties, please refer to [ðŸ”£ Block States](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/blocks/block-states).
