[ðŸ’¦ Concrete Powder Block](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/blocks/block-behaviors/concrete-powder-block) is a type of block that hardens when it comes into contact with water. A configuration example is shown below:

Copy

```
blocks:
  default:gunpowder_block:
    behavior:
      type: concrete_powder_block
      solid-block: default:solid_gunpowder_block
```

Currently, custom blocks cannot turn into blocks upon contacting water while in a falling entity state. This is because this piece of code is hardcoded in Minecraft, and we cannot modify its behavioral logic.
