[ðŸª¨ Sturdy Base Block](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/blocks/block-behaviors/sturdy-base-block) refers to blocks that need a sturdy supporting face. For example, doors won't work on dripstones. Support types include `full`, `rigid`, and `center`.
