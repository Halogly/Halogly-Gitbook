# 🕹️ Item Behaviors

Unlike [⚙️ Item Settings](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/items/item-settings), [🕹️ Item Behaviors](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/items/item-behaviors) is more about how something interacts—like the rules or logic behind those interactions. It checks each interaction rule **one by one, in order**, and stops at the **first valid one** it finds. Once that happens, any remaining behaviors **won’t even be checked**.
