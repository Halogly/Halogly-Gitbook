# üíé Loot Table

### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Under `loots`, there must be a `pools` list, which represents the loot pools. Each loot pool consists of four parts:

`rolls` determines how many times the pool is rolled `conditions` represent the conditions for the loot `entries` denote the actual loot items `functions` are the post-processing functions, such as modifying the quantity of the loot, NBT data, and so on

If you are well-acquainted with vanilla data packs, you will find this structure very familiar. The plugin employs this format and modifies it to facilitate a swift and smooth transition into the CraftEngine loot system.

Copy

```
loot:
  functions: []
  pools:
    - rolls: 1
      conditions:
        - type: survives_explosion
      entries:
        - type: item
          item: "minecraft:apple"
      functions: []
```

### ‚òòÔ∏è Entry <a href="#entry" id="entry"></a>

The 'entry' specifies the actual contents of the drop, but in certain scenarios, it can also represent a choice among possible drops.

All `entry` sections are capable of using `functions` and `conditions`.

Copy

```
type: item
item: "minecraft:apple"
functions: []
conditions: []
```

#### item <a href="#item" id="item"></a>

Set the type of the dropped item, which can be a custom item.

Copy

```
type: item
item: "minecraft:apple"
```

#### furniture\_item <a href="#furniture_item" id="furniture_item"></a>

Sets the item to the original furniture item when placed, otherwise uses the fallback item.

Copy

```
type: furniture_item
item: "default:fallback_item"
```

#### exp <a href="#exp" id="exp"></a>

Drop a certain amount of experience.

Copy

```
type: exp
count: 1
```

#### alternatives <a href="#alternatives" id="alternatives"></a>

Find the first `entry` from the given list that meets the `conditions`.

Copy

```
type: alternatives
children:
  - type: item
    item: "{ore_block}"
    conditions:
      - type: enchantment
        predicate: minecraft:silk_touch>=1
  - type: item
    item: "{ore_drop}"
    functions:
      - type: apply_bonus
        enchantment: minecraft:fortune
        formula:
          type: ore_drops
      - type: explosion_decay
      - type: drop_exp
        count:
          type: uniform
          min: "{min_exp}"
          max: "{max_exp}"
```

### üîß Function <a href="#function" id="function"></a>

The role of the `function` is to perform additional operations on the item after its type has been set, such as adjusting the quantity. It can also handle concurrent operations like dropping experience or other extras.

All `function` sections support the use of `conditions`.

Copy

```
type: set_count
count: 10
conditions: []
```

#### apply\_bonus <a href="#apply_bonus" id="apply_bonus"></a>

Increase the quantity of the dropped items based on the given enchantments and formulas. Refer to [‚ûïÔ∏è Formula](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/loot-table#formula) for more info.

Copy

```
type: apply_bonus
enchantment: minecraft:fortune
formula:
  type: ore_drops
```

#### set\_count <a href="#set_count" id="set_count"></a>

Set the count of the item.

Copy

```
type: set_count
count: 10
add: true  # add or set
```

#### explosion\_decay <a href="#explosion_decay" id="explosion_decay"></a>

Determines whether the quantity of this item diminishes upon explosion. In vanilla Minecraft, explosions often result in fewer blocks being dropped than originally present, which is due to the implementation of this function.

Copy

```
type: explosion_decay
```

#### drop\_exp <a href="#drop_exp" id="drop_exp"></a>

Drop a certain amount of experience.

Copy

```
type: drop_exp
count: 1
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è Condition <a href="#condition" id="condition"></a>

`condition` can provide prerequisites for both `entry` and `function`.

### ‚ûïÔ∏è Formula <a href="#formula" id="formula"></a>

#### ore\_drops <a href="#ore_drops" id="ore_drops"></a>

The same drop algorithm used in vanilla Minecraft.

Copy

```
type: ore_drops
```

#### binomial\_with\_bonus\_count <a href="#binomial_with_bonus_count" id="binomial_with_bonus_count"></a>

The same binomial drop algorithm used in vanilla Minecraft. `extra` means a few extra attempts to drop the item, and `probability` represents the probability of success each time. The enchantment level will increase the number of attempts.

Copy

```
type: binomial_with_bonus_count
extra: 3
probability: 0.5
```
