# ðŸŒ¿ Grass Block

[ðŸŒ¿ Grass Block](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/blocks/block-behaviors/grass-block) allows you to perform bonemeal on them to grow grass and flowers. Don't forget to add tag `minecraft:dirt` to your blocks otherwise grass won't survive on them. Check [tags](https://mo-mi.gitbook.io/xiaomomi-plugins/craftengine/plugin-wiki/craftengine/add-new-contents/blocks/block-settings#tags) if you don't know how to add tags to your block.
